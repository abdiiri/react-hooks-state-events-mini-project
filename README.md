# Putting it All Together: Components and Props

## Learning Goals

- Create components that return JSX
- Use props to make components dynamic
- Transform lists of data into lists of components

## Overview

Now that you've learned how to work with components in React, it's time to build
something and put those skills to use! Your goal for this lab is to make a
_static site_ in React to practice building components, writing JSX, and passing
down data as props.

We'll be creating a personal blog site, similar to
[Dan Abramov's Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/):

![demo](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-2/react-hooks-component-props-mini-project/demo.png)

There is some starter code available in `src/components/App.js`. There is also
some data in `data/blog.js` that is being imported into `App` so you can pass it
down to the components that need it.

## Deliverables

Have a look at the components below and draw out a component hierarchy so you
can determine how to pass data down as props.

### Header

Make a `Header` component as a child of `App`. It should return:

- a `<header>` element with the following elements inside:
  - an `<h1>` with the name of the blog, passed as a prop called `name`

### About

Make an `About` component as a child of `App`. It should return:

- an `<aside>` element with the following elements inside:
  - an `<img>` element, with the `src` set to an image passed as a prop called
    `image`
  - the `<img>` element should use this placeholder image as a _default value_
    for the prop if no prop is passed in: "https://via.placeholder.com/215"
  - the image should also be accessible! Give it an `alt` attribute of "blog
    logo"
  - a `<p>` element, with the text for the blog passed in as a prop called
    `about`

### ArticleList

Make an `ArticleList` component as a child of `App`. It should return:

- a `<main>` element with the following components inside:
  - an array of `Article` components (one component for each of the `posts`
    passed down as props to `ArticleList`)
  - make sure to assign a unique `key` attribute to each `Article`

### Article

Make an `Article` component as a child of `ArticleList`. It should return:

- an `<article>` element, with the following elements inside:
  - an `<h3>` element displaying the title of the article, passed as a prop
    called `title`
  - a `<small>` element displaying the date of the article, passed as a prop
    called `date`
    - a _default value_ of "January 1, 1970" should be used if no date is passed
      as a prop
  - a `<p>` element displaying the preview of the article, passed as a prop
    called `preview`

### Bonus Feature: 'Minutes to Read'

You'll notice in the original [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/) site,
there's a 'minutes to read' indicator next to each article.

If the article takes less than 30 minutes to read:

- For every 5 minutes (rounded up to the nearest 5), display a coffee cup emoji.
  For example, if the article takes 3 minutes to read, you should display "☕️ 3
  min read". If the article takes 7 minute, you should display "☕️☕️ 7 min
  read".

If the article takes 30 minutes or longer to read:

- For every 10 minutes (rounded up to the nearest 10), display a bento box
  emoji. For example, if the article takes 35 minutes to read, you should
  display "🍱🍱🍱🍱 35 min read". If the article takes 61 minutes to read, you
  should display "🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱🍱 61 min read".

There aren't tests for this feature, so you'll have to rely on running the code
in the browser to see if your implementation works!

# Putting it All Together: State and Events

## Learning Goals

- Use state and events to make components dynamic
- Implement controlled components

## Introduction

To build on what you've learned over the course of this section, we'll be
building out a simple task list app to practice working with state and events,
focusing in particular on working with arrays.

## Deliverables

There is some starter code built out for all of the components you'll need. The
data for the application is imported in `App`, so you'll need to pass that data
down to the components that need it as props.

Run `npm install` and `npm start`, then check out the starter code in the
browser. You'll see a console message with the `TASK` and `CATEGORY` data you'll
need to pass down from `App`.

### TaskList

First, we'll want to display all the tasks in our app. Pass down the task data
from `App` to `TaskList`, and display each task using the `Task` component. Make
sure to use a `key` prop!

### Task

Update the `Task` component so that it shows the task's text and category.

_When the delete button is clicked_, the task should be removed from the list.

### CategoryFilter

Pass the list of categories to this component from `App`. Then, update this
component to display `<button>` elements for each category. In order to pass the test, the buttons will need a key prop equal to the category.

_When a button is clicked_, the following should happen:

- Whichever button was clicked should have a class of `selected`. The other
  buttons should not have any class assigned.
- The list of tasks being displayed should be filtered, so that only tasks that
  match the category that was clicked are displayed.
- If the button for "All" is selected, all the tasks should be displayed.

### NewTaskForm

Pass the list of categories to this component from `App`. Then, update this
component to display `<option>` elements for each category inside of the
`<select>` element **except** the "All" category, so that the user can select a
category when adding a new task.

Next, update this form to be a _controlled component_, so that all form inputs
are captured in state.

_When the form is submitted_, add a new task to the list with the text and
category from the form. For the tests for this feature to pass, you'll need a
callback prop named `onTaskFormSubmit` that takes a task object as an argument.
